On macOS 64-bit capable processors are assumed to support SSSE3. This is not the case for older 64-bit capable Pentium processors, which cause some applications to crash on macOS 10.6. This behaviour corresponds to -legacy kernel boot argument. This option is unavailable for 10.4 and 10.5 when running on 64-bit firmware due to an uninitialised 64-bit segment in the XNU kernel, which causes AppleEFIRuntime to incorrectly execute 64-bit code as 16-bit code.\n• x86_64 — Use x86_64 (64-bit) kernel when available.\n\nBelow is the algorithm determining the kernel architecture.\n(a) arch argument in image arguments (e.g. when launched via UEFI Shell) or in boot-args variable overrides any compatibility checks and forces the specified architecture, completing this algorithm.\n(b) OpenCore build architecture restricts capabilities to i386 and i386-user32 mode for the 32-bit firmware variant.\n(c) Determined EfiBoot version restricts architecture choice:\n• 10.4-10.5 — i386 or i386-user32 (only on 32-bit firmware)\n• 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n• 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n• 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n(d) If KernelArch is set to Auto and SSSE3 is not supported by the CPU, capabilities are restricted to i386-user32 if supported by EfiBoot.\n(e) Board identifier (from SMBIOS) based on EfiBoot version disables x86_64 support on an unsupported model if any i386 variant is supported. Auto is not consulted here as the list is not overridable in EfiBoot.\n(f) KernelArch restricts the support to the explicitly specified architecture (when not set to Auto) if the architecture remains present in the capabilities.\n(g) The best supported architecture is chosen in this order: x86_64, i386, i386-user32.\nUnlike macOS 10.7, where select boards identifiers are treated as the i386 only machines, and macOS 10.5 or earlier, where x86_64 is not supported by the macOS kernel, macOS 10.6 is very special. The architecture choice on macOS 10.6 depends on many factors including not only the board identifier, but also macOS product type (client vs server), macOS point release, and RAM amount. The detection of them all is complicated and not practical, because several point releases had genuine bugs and failed to properly perform the server detection in the first place. For this reason OpenCore on macOS 10.6 will fallback to x86_64 architecture whenever it is supported by the board at all, as on macOS 10.7. As a reference here is the 64-bit Mac model compatibility corresponding to actual EfiBoot behaviour on macOS 10.6.8 and 10.7.5.\n\nNote: 3+2 and 6+4 hotkeys to choose the preferred architecture are unsupported due to being handled by EfiBoot and thus being hard to properly detect."; ObjectID = "zDQ-MU-J9A"; */

On macOS 64-bit capable processors are assumed to support SSSE3. This is not the case for older 64-bit capable Pentium processors, which cause some applications to crash on macOS 10.6. This behaviour corresponds to -legacy kernel boot argument. This option is unavailable for 10.4 and 10.5 when running on 64-bit firmware due to an uninitialised 64-bit segment in the XNU kernel, which causes AppleEFIRuntime to incorrectly execute 64-bit code as 16-bit code.\n• x86_64 — Use x86_64 (64-bit) kernel when available.\n\nBelow is the algorithm determining the kernel architecture.\n(a) arch argument in image arguments (e.g. when launched via UEFI Shell) or in boot-args variable overrides any compatibility checks and forces the specified architecture, completing this algorithm.\n(b) OpenCore build architecture restricts capabilities to i386 and i386-user32 mode for the 32-bit firmware variant.\n(c) Determined EfiBoot version restricts architecture choice:\n• 10.4-10.5 — i386 or i386-user32 (only on 32-bit firmware)\n• 10.6 — i386, i386-user32, or x86_64\n• 10.7 — i386 or x86_64\n• 10.8 or newer — x86_64\n(d) If KernelArch is set to Auto and SSSE3 is not supported by the CPU, capabilities are restricted to i386-user32 if supported by EfiBoot.\n(e) Board identifier (from SMBIOS) based on EfiBoot version disables x86_64 support on an unsupported model if any i386 variant is supported. Auto is not consulted here as the list is not overridable in EfiBoot.\n(f) KernelArch restricts the support to the explicitly specified architecture (when not set to Auto) if the architecture remains present in the capabilities.\n(g) The best supported architecture is chosen in this order: x86_64, i386, i386-user32.\nUnlike macOS 10.7, where select boards identifiers are treated as the i386 only machines, and macOS 10.5 or earlier, where x86_64 is not supported by the macOS kernel, macOS 10.6 is very special. The architecture choice on macOS 10.6 depends on many factors including not only the board identifier, but also macOS product type (client vs server), macOS point release, and RAM amount. The detection of them all is complicated and not practical, because several point releases had genuine bugs and failed to properly perform the server detection in the first place. For this reason OpenCore on macOS 10.6 will fallback to x86_64 architecture whenever it is supported by the board at all, as on macOS 10.7. As a reference here is the 64-bit Mac model compatibility corresponding to actual EfiBoot behaviour on macOS 10.6.8 and 10.7.5.\n\nNote: 3+2 and 6+4 hotkeys to choose the preferred architecture are unsupported due to being handled by EfiBoot and thus being hard to properly detect.";
